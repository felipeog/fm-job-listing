### Filtering

#### Option 1

Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML `data-` attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the [index.html](./index.html) file.

The categories are:

- Role: Frontend, Backend, Fullstack
- Level: Junior, Midweight, Senior
- Languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: React, Sass, Vue, Django, RoR (Ruby on Rails)

So, if a job listing is for has the following categories `Frontend, Junior, JavaScript, React` your HTML data attributes would look like this `data-role="frontend" data-level="junior" data-languages="javascript" data-tools="react"`.

#### Option 2

Use the [data.json](./data.json) file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.

To add a filter, the user needs to click on the tablets on the right-side of the listing on desktop or the bottom on mobile. For each filter added, only listings containing all selected filters should be returned.
